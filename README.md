# Pokémon Red++

This is based on the [**Pokémon Red Disassembly**][pokered]

Red++ serves as an updated version of Pokémon Red.

It fixes a lot of bugs leftover from original Red and Blue, as well as adding new features.
It builds two versions, a "Normal" version and a "Hard" version. The only difference is the level curve.

For a list of features, check out [**FEATURES.md**](FEATURES.md).
